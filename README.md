- 👋 Hi, I’m @missionfromdog (Casey Hess/Chicago)
- 👀 I’m interested in data products, data science, truth with numbers.
- 🌱 I’m currently overseeing a team of 100+ in data operations for a major Media Holdco.
- I also have a background with product development, strategic growth, data science, and over 20 years of leadership on my resume.
- On the side, after completing a data science bootcamp with Metis, I'm continuing to learn.  From vibe-coding apps to SQL, Python, Machine Learning, Probability/Stats, Bayesian, and anything else I can get my brain on.
- Familiarity with most cloud platforms (GCP/Biquery/Looker, Databricks, AWS).
